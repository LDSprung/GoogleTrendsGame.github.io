            <h1>Rules:</h1>
            <p>The Google Trends game is about competing with your friends to try and guess the most searched
                terms across the world.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>To start, open the link to the google trends page at the top of the screen. This is where
                    you will enter in search terms, and determine the points. Google trends allows you to type
                    in search terms, and see how many people have searched that term in a given time period. 
                    For this game, you will be looking at search terms worldwide over the past 30 days.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Once you have opened the google trends page, enter the names of the people playing in the 
                    text boxes for the player numbers. When you are done, click on "Create Players", and you 
                    should see the names update on the table below. For games with more then 5 players, it 
                    is recommended to split into teams.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Use the "Generate" button to generate a random word to use as a prompt. Once the random 
                    word has been chosen, players will have 30 seconds to come up with a word to pair with that
                    promt. For example, if the promt is "Water", you might come up with "Water Bottle", or 
                    "Sea Water". You can use the "Start Timer" button to help you keep track of time.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Once the time is up, go over to the google trends tab you opened earlier, and type in 
                    everyones phrases that they have come up with. Phrases must consist of the prompt word, 
                    alongside ONE other word, seperated by a space (You can't get the word "swim" and have 
                    your phrase be "Swimming"). Players cannot use the same search terms as each other, so 
                    make sure you come up with a few extras. The person with the LOWEST total score goes
                    first, up to the person with the highest score.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Once all the search terms have been entered, you should see multiple trend lines on the screen 
                    in the google trends tab. Players recieve points based on the average number of searches their 
                    term got, shown in the bar graph on the left hand side of the screen. Enter each players points
                    in the table under the column with their name, then click "Calculate Score". The scores will 
                    be added up and displayed in the "Total" row directly underneath the players names. The 
                    player with the highest score at the end of 10 rounds wins!
